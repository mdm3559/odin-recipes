    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These spinach and feta turkey burgers are a big hit in the summertime when everyone is tired of the same old hamburgers and hot dogs. Serve with or without buns and your favorite condiments. I like to serve these with lettuce, tomato, and tzatziki sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground turkey</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) box frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry</li>
        <li>4 ounces feta cheese</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Mix together turkey, spinach, feta, eggs, and garlic in a large bowl until well combined; form into 8 patties.</li>
        <li>Cook patties on the preheated grill on both sides until no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of patties should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
